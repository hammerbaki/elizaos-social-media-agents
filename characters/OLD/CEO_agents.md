# Applications: Multi-Platform AI Agent Design in ElizaOS

This section presents the design and implementation of three platform-specific AI agents developed using the ElizaOS framework. The agents are configured through a JSON file, which acts as the core blueprint for each agent’s fundamental personality and interaction style. This character configuration follows a standardized character schema composed of six modular components: Bio, Lore, Post Examples, Style, Topics, and Adjectives (https://github.com/elizaOS/characters accessed on 28 March 2025). These components collectively define the agents’ persona structure, behavioral logic, and communication style (Walters et al., 2025), ensuring a cohesive and recognizable online presence.

The agents were designed to support the institutional communication goals of CEO Business School across three digital platforms: Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. Each platform imposes unique affordances, user expectations, and interaction modalities. Accordingly, each agent’s persona is customized to align with the respective platform’s communicative norms, audience behavior, and functional purpose. The following subsections detail the composition of each key section of the character JSON file, which dictates the agent’s behavior and communication: Bio (concise introduction), Lore (history and background), PostExamples (communication style on social media), Style (language and tone guidelines), Topics (areas of interest), and Adjectives (descriptive words capturing character essence).

## 1. Defining the Agent Persona: Bio Layer

The Bio section represents the core identity and role definition of each AI agent. It functions as a compact, high-level descriptor that shapes how the agent is perceived by users across different platforms (Sutcliffe, 2023). 

Within the ElizaOS framework, the bio field fulfills three essential functions. Primarily, it anchors contextual relevance by directly expressing the agent’s institutional affiliation—such as CEO Business School—and its primary domain focus (Biro et al., 2023), including areas like AI, blockchain, and business innovation. Furthermore, it supports prompt engineering by providing grounding cues that enable the language model to adopt an appropriate tone and demonstrate subject-matter expertise during interaction (https://docsbot.ai/prompts/writing/persona-prompt-engineer accessed on 28 March 2025). Finally, it facilitates dynamic response framing by supplying structured cues that allow the ElizaOS runtime system to adapt the agent’s behavior (Sutcliffe, 2023), particularly in environments requiring brevity and clarity, such as Twitter and Telegram. 

Each bio entry consists of two to four modular sentences, encapsulating identity, expertise, interaction style, and user value proposition. These modular elements can be randomized or selectively combined to introduce entropy, supporting a wider range of varied yet coherent outputs (Pilato et al., 2011). Similar to a social media bio, these entries often serve as the first point of contact for users, making conciseness and clarity crucial. Effective bio construction highlights the agent’s defining characteristics, ensuring a strong initial impression and clearly communicating the agent’s fundamental essence and purpose. Consideration of platform-specific constraints is also essential; Twitter requires particularly concise phrasing due to character limitations, while platforms like Discord and Telegram allow for greater descriptive flexibility. Reviewing successful bio examples across platforms can further guide effective phrasing and optimal length. The full configuration of bio entries for each agent is presented in Table 3.

Table 3. Persona descriptions (Bio) of AI agents.

| Agent Name                 | Bio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agile  <br>Thought Leader  | “A dynamic, concise, and witty AI agent representing CEO Business School on Twitter.”,  <br>“Expert in AI, blockchain, digital transformation, and business innovation.”,  <br>“Engages with industry leaders and followers through timely insights and interactive content.”                                                                                               |
| Community  <br>Mentor      | “An engaging and community-oriented AI agent acting as a mentor within the CEO Business School Discord server.”,  <br>“Dedicated to fostering a welcoming and interactive learning environment.”,  <br>“Facilitates discussions on AI, blockchain, and digital innovation.”,  <br>“Provides access to exclusive content and encourages peer-to-peer learning.”              |
| Information  <br>Concierge | “An informative, professional, and approachable AI agent serving as a secure information concierge on Telegram for the CEO Business School community.”, <br>“Provides personalized, secure, and timely information and assistance.”,  <br>“Delivers updates on courses, token news, and important announcements.”,  <br>“Offers guidance and support to community members.” |

This structured Bio layer ensures each agent aligns with the communication norms and audience expectations of its assigned platform—whether concise authority on Twitter, interactive warmth on Discord, or professional clarity on Telegram. It also supports a modular design approach, enabling rapid adaptation and deployment of additional agents across other channels or use cases.

## 2. Narrative Function Layer: Lore

The Lore section complements the Bio by adding background narratives, operational context, and behavioral grounding to each agent. While the Bio defines who the agent is, the Lore explains why the agent exists and how it functions within its communication environment. It provides narrative scaffolding that supports behavioral patterns, origin logic, and community contributions specific to each platform (Sutcliffe, 2023). Similar to a character’s history in storytelling or the detailed background often developed for role-playing characters, the Lore section delves deeply into the foundational elements shaping each agent’s persona and guiding present behaviors and interactions. Like the Bio, the Lore entries in ElizaOS can be structured as collections of short, randomized snippets, allowing nuanced and multifaceted presentations of the agent’s history. 

Within the ElizaOS framework, the Lore layer serves three core functions. Initially, it enables instructional contextualization, embedding intent-driven background logic that can be leveraged to condition responses, trigger domain-specific actions, or simulate continuity across longer-term user interactions (L. Li et al., 2021). In addition, it provides behavioral anchoring (Murphy & Constans, 1987), helping define the agent’s consistent default persona—such as preferred content styles, response formats, or reactions to edge-case prompts (Zhou & Li, 2024). Lastly, it contributes to user engagement design by offering a narrative origin or mission that resonates with users, thereby increasing emotional connection and sustained interaction (Chow et al., 2023). 

Each Lore entry consists of two to five modular sentences, which may be referenced dynamically or selectively invoked to support more coherent and contextually rich conversations. The detailed narrative and functional backstory for each agent is summarized in Table 4.

Table 4. Narrative and operational background (Lore) of AI agents.

| Agent Name                 | Lore                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agile  <br>Thought Leader  | “Created to monitor trending topics related to disruptive business technologies and integrate them into engaging tweets.”,  <br>“Utilizes interactive formats like polls and Q&A to spark conversations and foster community engagement.”                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Community  <br>Mentor      | “Guides students and members across Discord learning channels.”,  <br>“Promotes interactive learning, support, and peer mentoring.”,  <br>“Hosts AMA sessions and knowledge challenges.”,  <br>“Moderates specialized channels, initiates thought-provoking Q&A sessions, and organizes quizzes and challenges to foster peer-to-peer learning.”                                                                                       |
| Information  <br>Concierge | “Created to streamline communication for enrolled students and prospects.”,  <br>“Specialist in program schedules, token updates, and event reminders.”,  <br>“Ensures clear, secure, and personalized messaging.”,  <br>“Leveraging Telegram’s robust bot API, this agent broadcasts clear and professional updates, offers personalized guidance, and uses access controls to maintain secure communication tailored to user needs.” |

This narrative function layer reinforces functional consistency, enabling agents to simulate long-term goals, institutional memory, and user alignment—features especially critical for conversational platforms with persistent interaction patterns, such as Discord or Telegram.

## 3. Communicative Simulation Layer: Post Examples

The Post Examples layer defines how each AI agent communicates publicly within its designated platform, simulating real-world engagement through short-form content such as tweets, Discord announcements, and Telegram updates. This section is crucial for demonstrating the desired tone, style, and content, allowing the AI model to understand and emulate effective communication strategies tailored to each platform (Sutcliffe, 2023). Given the distinct nature of platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Telegram, these examples must reflect their unique communication norms and user expectations. Twitter’s strict character limits necessitate concise, impactful posts frequently incorporating relevant hashtags, while Discord encourages community interaction through longer, informal messages with mentions and emojis. Telegram’s versatility supports diverse media formats and caters to both public broadcasts and private interactions, requiring examples showcasing this flexibility. 

Within the ElizaOS framework, this layer serves several interconnected functions. It provides grounded language modeling by offering exemplar utterances that fine-tune the agent’s stylistic output, ensuring brevity, structural consistency, and domain-specific language relevant to each platform (Følstad & Taylor, 2021). It supports persona reinforcement by aligning communicative identity—witty, supportive, or professional—with the configured Bio and Lore (Lim et al., 2024; Oh et al., 2021). These examples act as linguistic anchors, stabilizing personality in public contexts, and as behavioral sampling data, defining the acceptable output range to maintain flexibility and human-like expression diversity (J. Zhang et al., 2020). Furthermore, the Post Examples layer enables task-type modeling by embedding functional social actions (Yu et al., 2025), such as announcements, polls, reminders, and resource sharing, illustrating the agent as an active digital communication participant (Hmoud et al., 2024). 

Each entry below serves as a canonical sample the agent may reuse, adapt, or emulate during deployment. These samples align semantically with platform norms like hashtags on Twitter, slash commands in Discord and Telegram, or time-sensitive reminders for events. The full set of examples is presented in Table 5.

Table 5. Representative public posts and announcements (Post Examples).

| Agent Name                 | Post Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This layer plays a central role in aligning natural language output with platform-specific conventions and user expectations, ensuring stylistic consistency and functional coherence across diverse communication environments.

## 4. Stylistic Modulation Layer: Style

The Style layer defines each agent’s linguistic tone, communication mannerisms, and personality projection across three distinct modalities ([https://github.com/elizaOS/characters](https://github.com/elizaOS/characters) accessed on 28 March 2025):

- All: General tone and behavior guidelines that apply universally.
- Chat: Real-time or direct messaging interactions (Discord, Telegram).
- Post: Public or broadcast-style communication (tweets and announcements).

In the ElizaOS framework, the Style section specifies guidelines for how the agent communicates, encompassing aspects like overall tone (formal, informal, humorous), vocabulary, sentence structure, and characteristic communication habits. A key capability of ElizaOS is its ability to define context-specific styles, crucial for establishing a recognizable, consistent, and coherent persona across various social media posts and interactions. This consistency in tone and subject matter builds user trust and recognition, essential for effective engagement. The style embeddings in this layer help guide language generation, ensuring the agent’s voice is coherent and recognizable across modalities (Mairesse & Walker, 2007). For example, the linguistic output on Twitter should reflect platform norms such as brevity and hashtags, while still maintaining alignment with the agent’s defined tone—professional, academic, or conversational. The Style layer also promotes modality awareness by aligning linguistic format with interaction type, optimizing output for asynchronous versus synchronous channels (Shin et al., 2023). Additionally, this layer supports adaptive presentation, enabling the agent to fluidly shift tone across contexts without compromising core identity or behavioral fidelity (Mairesse & Walker, 2010). 

Each style entry includes curated descriptors referenced by the rendering engine to condition real-time generation logic. Writing the style instructions using the same language and tone that the agent will employ further reinforces consistency and realism. Effective style definitions consider platform-specific communication norms—more formal and professional on platforms like LinkedIn versus casual on Discord. Observing examples of bot communication across platforms helps refine these style decisions, ranging from concise factual updates to conversational interactions. Detailed stylistic configurations for the agents are presented in Table 6.

Table 6. Style definitions across modalities (Style).

| Agent Name                 | All                                                                           | Chat                                                         | Post                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

This stylistic framing enables semantic and emotional consistency across diverse communication environments, ensuring each agent maintains a clear, appropriate, and effective presence tailored to user expectations (Mairesse & Walker, 2010).

## 5. Thematic Scope and Personality Anchors: Topics and Adjectives

In the ElizaOS framework, the Topics and Adjectives layers function as distinct yet complementary components shaping the agent’s content domain and communicative style. Together, these layers ensure thematic coherence and consistent persona across different platforms and interaction contexts.

The Topics layer defines the semantic scope of the agent—what it knows, talks about, and prioritizes in conversations (G. Yager, 2023). These topic tags inform content generation, relevance to trending keywords, and platform-specific interaction cues such as hashtag usage. They delineate the thematic boundaries of the agent’s knowledge base, aligning the output with organizational goals and user expectations (Bunt & Petukhova, 2023). In parallel, the Adjectives layer refines the agent’s persona using descriptive words that encapsulate its core traits and personality, dynamically influencing stylistic framing during message generation (de Gennaro et al., 2020). Selecting appropriate adjectives involves careful consideration of the intended character and resonance with the target audience. Consistency with the character’s Bio and Lore is essential, ensuring a coherent and believable persona. The adjectives help define the tone and overall impression conveyed—whether witty, supportive, professional, or analytical—thus enhancing the agent’s realism and relatability in user interactions (Chew, 2022). Table 7 presents the detailed configuration of thematic domains and personality traits (Topics and Adjectives) for each agent.

Table 7. Thematic domains and personality traits (Topics and Adjectives).

| Agent Name                 | Topics                                                                                                                  | Adjectives                                                                                                                        |

These layers enable the ElizaOS agents to maintain thematic consistency and personality continuity across diverse interactions. The Agile Thought Leader responds adeptly to discussions on emerging technologies and leadership trends on Twitter. The Community Mentor focuses on fostering peer learning, entrepreneurial thinking, and community support within Discord. Meanwhile, the Information Concierge offers structured, secure updates to students and stakeholders via Telegram. By clearly encoding both thematic content (topics) and expressive traits (adjectives), these layers effectively bridge high-level design intentions with practical, context-specific communicative behavior.
